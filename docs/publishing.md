# Publishing

The planned xcb pipeline publishes `@hraness/xcb` and native binaries from one
tag channel. As of September 19, 2026, xcb has no published release; existing
v0.3.0 assets are AgentMixer. This document describes the release contract, not
publication evidence.
An immutable annotated `v<version>` tag at a reviewed commit in current `main`
history is a release request. The tag version must equal `package.json`'s
`version`; no other tag shape is admitted.

## Release contract

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs the whole pipeline. Its jobs:

1. **Verify release source.** Confirms the push is one exact `v*` tag, resolves
   the tag to its commit, proves the commit is an ancestor of exact advertised
   `main`, and proves the tag is the newest advertised stable tag. Stages the
   dependency-free release writers from the tagged source and preserves them as
   workflow artifacts so later jobs execute reviewed bytes, not a fresh
   checkout. Runs the complete `bun run check` gate, then builds `dist/` and
   packs the one release tarball with `npm pack --ignore-scripts`. Writes
   `SHA256SUMS` over the tarball and preserves both as artifacts.
2. **Exact tarball install.** On Ubuntu and macOS, downloads the release bytes
   by numeric artifact ID, verifies the checksum, and runs the packed-package
   smoke check: the tarball installs into an isolated consumer and the public
   entry executes — including an account-lease custody round trip — under both
   Bun and Node.
3. **Native binary build.** On Ubuntu and macOS, checks out the verified tag
   commit, builds `xcb` with the pinned Rust toolchain through
   `scripts/build-native.sh`, and preserves
   `xcb-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` plus its adjacent `.sha256` checksum as
   run-bound workflow artifacts.
4. **Publish immutable GitHub Release.** The only job holding
   `contents: write`. Creates the immutable Latest GitHub Release carrying the
   exact tarball, `SHA256SUMS`, and every native archive/checksum pair, then
   proves it back.
5. **Pre-npm admission.** Proves the immutable GitHub Release bytes match the
   packed artifact and admits the npm retry state: absent, or an exact same-run
   retry only.
6. **Publish npm.** The only job holding `id-token: write`. Downloads the exact
   bytes and the reviewed dependency-free npm writer, rechecks the checksum,
   and publishes through npm OIDC trusted publishing with provenance. No npm
   token exists anywhere in the pipeline.
7. **Admission.** Verifies the exact registry version, repository, tag,
   ancestry, bytes, and Sigstore provenance — the provenance certificate must
   bind this repository, this workflow, this tag, and this run.

A failed or interrupted run leaves quarantine, not retry authority: the
pre-npm job only admits a retry that is an exact continuation of the same run.

## Repository protections

- `main` delivery is protected by the organization "Protect main delivery"
  ruleset: changes arrive through reviewed pull requests with required checks.
- `v*` tags are protected by the organization "Immutable version tags"
  ruleset: a tag names one commit forever.
- Release-critical paths (workflows, release scripts, `package.json`,
  `bun.lock`, this document) are owned in `.github/CODEOWNERS`.
- The former scoped tag namespaces (`agentmixer-v*`, `agentrouter-v*`,
  `xcb-v*`) and the former `hraness/textbutler` repository identity are
  rejected by the release checks on purpose.

## Site deployment

`site/` deploys to Vercel as `xcb.sh` through the standard Git
integration on `main`. The site is informational only; it carries no product
runtime and no release authority.

## Native binary release

The `native_artifact` job inside `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds `xcb`
for Ubuntu and macOS from the verified tag commit through
`scripts/build-native.sh`. The publish job attaches
`xcb-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` and its adjacent `.sha256` checksum to the
release draft alongside the package tarball and `SHA256SUMS`; all assets become
immutable together when the release is published. This folding is required, not
cosmetic: a published GitHub Release is immutable, so assets cannot be added
afterward — the former `release-native.yml` `workflow_run` follower could
neither see the tag ref nor extend the finalized release, and has been removed.
Native artifacts are not published to npm; they are a separate release surface
alongside the `@hraness/xcb` compatibility package.

## Site publication datum

`site/published-release.json` keeps `version`, `archiveUrl`, and
`verificationRun` null until a verified xcb package exists. The homepage then
shows the source installation path and offers no archive download. After public
release verification passes, set all three fields to the exact stable version,
existing `hraness-xcb-<version>.tgz` asset URL, and successful
`https://github.com/hraness/xcb/actions/runs/<run-id>` URL.

Verify the actual asset and its packed manifest (`name: @hraness/xcb`, matching
version), checksum, and provenance before changing the datum. A pre-rename
AgentMixer release cannot satisfy this contract: do not invent an xcb asset URL
from its version number. The site validates the explicit archive coordinate and
never rewrites README installation commands to another release version.
Keep all fields null if publication or verification is incomplete. Regenerate
the README with `cd site && bun run sync:readme`, then run `bun run check` before
deploying. Native binary availability must be verified separately; a compatibility
archive does not prove native artifacts exist.
